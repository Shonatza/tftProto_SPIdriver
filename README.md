# TFT Driver

Project developed as part of the **DSBM** (Design of Systems Based on Microcontrollers) subject at **FIB**.

## Features

- **SPI Communication**: Implements reliable communication between the Raspberry Pi and the TFT display using the SPI protocol.
- **Display Control**: Provides functionality to print basic forms and loaded images in the TFT display.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures efficient data transfer and rendering for smooth display operation.
- **Modular Design**: Organized code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed to demonstrate SPI communication and display control concepts in embedded systems.

## Hardware used
